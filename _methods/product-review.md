## How to do it
1. Form a project planning group for your team. This team will first determine the objectives and goals of the project, and once work begins, they will manage to see if the plan is being kept to.
2. To begin making the plan, do an initial assessment of the issues that need to be worked through and the difficulties that may be encountered in the project.
3. Whenever possible, involve the community to get feedback on their needs, whether through town halls or focus groups.
4. As the project continues, manage the plan, and make adjustments if necessary.
